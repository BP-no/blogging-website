    <h1>This site is going to be very blue</h1>
    <h2>Other things you should expect:</h2>
    <p>
 <ul> – Very long ramblings about music </ul>
 <ul> – Many essays about books I have read </ul>
 <ul> – Even more essays about life in general and what I feel like I should be doing </ul>
 <ul> – A lot more. </ul> <br>

p.s: I am designing this entire website on canva and cropping images with GIMP. The struggle is real. <br> <br>
